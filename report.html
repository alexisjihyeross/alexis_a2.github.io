			<h2>Subtheme: Housing for the Rich</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Question 1:</b> <i>What types of properties are being sold in Boston, specifically in the luxury units? (ie are they 1-bedroom units or family units?)</i> I am wondering because the Boston Globe article mentioned that only 16% of One Dalton’s units are owners’ primary homes, and so I wonder if the units are small units meant for individuals or for families.</li>
				<li><b>Question 2:</b> <i>How have the uses of properties and identities of property buyers changed over time? For instance, are properties being increasingly bought by corporate buyers as long-term investments? As short term flips?</i> I am curious because the Boston Globe article talked about the phenomenon of large corporations buying housing stock and selling it for profit, particularly recently, and I am curious to see if this data would reflect that trend. After reading the ProPublica article for A1 discussing that many buildings in the US are owned by a small number of large private equity firms, I wonder if we would observe the same thing for luxury buildings in Boston—ie that a few companies/buyers are buying a large share of the properties.</li>
				<li><b>Question 3:</b> <i>Where are luxury buildings being bought?</i> I am interested in this question because the Boston Globe article talked about how the affordable housing build by One Dalton's developers was 1.5 miles away from One Dalton; such distance suggests that we would see property inequities geographically distributed, with certain areas of Boston having higher concentrations of luxury buildings than others. </li>

				We begin our exploratory data anlysis with Question 1, looking at what types of properties are being sold in Boston. We start by getting an overview of how the prices, total number of rooms, and interior square footage of properties sold are distributed in the dataset. This bar chart shows the <b>average selling price</b> of units sold by <b>total number of rooms</b>. The color indicates the <b>interior square footage</b> of the unit. 
				<br><br>
				We observe, as expected, that <b>units with more rooms tend to have higher average prices</b>, with <b>two main exceptions</b>. First, units with 19 rooms have lower average prices than units with fewer rooms. Looking at the data that makes up this bar, we see that there is only one unit with 19 total rooms, and as shown by the color of the bar, it has a lower interior square footage than the average unit with 17 or 18 rooms. Therefore, we can conclude that the lower price is due to the smaller size of this particular unit. 
				
				<br><br>
				The second exception is that units with 0 total rooms have significantly higher average prices than all other units (as indicated by the bar size), as well as significantly higher interior square footage (as indicated by the bar color). This raises the question of <i>what these units with 0 total rooms are</i>, and <i>why they are so expensive</i>. We will explore this further in the next visualization.

				<figcaption>
				This three-part visualization is intended to answer the question raised by the previous visualization: <i>What types of properties make up the large number of units with 0 total rooms?</i> This visualization shows the <b>counts</b>, <b>average selling prices</b>, and <b>average interior square footage</b> for units by <b>property type</b> (residential/non-residential and their property usage), specifically for the subset of units with 0 total rooms. The residential vs. non-residential categories were manually labeled by looking at the property usage. 
				<br><br>
				This visualization highlights several insights. First, we see that many of the units with 0 total rooms are non-residential. Second, we see that the average selling price of non-residential units is higher than that of residential units, with non-residential banks and department stores having particularly high selling prices. Third, we see that the average interior square footage of non-residential units, particularly for farms and stadiums, is also higher than that of residential units. Together, these insights suggest that units with 0 total rooms tend to be <b>non-residential</b>, and that non-residential units tend to be <b>larger</b> and <b>more expensive</b> than residential units. This is consistent with our earlier observation that units with 0 total rooms have higher average prices and interior square footage than all other units. 
				Given that this subtheme aims to investigate <i>housing properties</i> specifically, we choose to <b>filter out non-residential units</b> from our analysis in the next visualization. 
				<br><br>
				Our fourth insight is that 4-8 and 9+ unit apartments make up a decent number of the units with 0 total rooms, suggesting that "0 total rooms" perhaps is used to indicate something special about the property, such as that the property has been developed for a specific purpose. Since looking at the meta-data and associated <a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/08/wr/classificationcodebook.pdf">housing guide</a> did not clarify the meaning of these 4-8 and 9+ unit apartments, and since they are not labeled as commercial according to the 'proptype' (property type) field, we will plan to include these units in the rest of our analyses.

				We now turn to a more targeted analysis of Question 1, specifically looking at <i>what types of luxury properties are being bought and re-sold</i> in Boston. We specifically look at <b>units with price > $1,000,000</b>, and we analyze the <b>number of bedrooms</b> in these units, along with their average <b>flip horizons</b> in months (ie months elapsed between buying and selling). This visualization shows the distribution of the number of bedrooms in these luxury units, where counts of bedrooms are proportional to the area of the squares. Colors of the squares indicate the average flip horizon in months for units with that number of bedrooms. We filter units with null flip horizons (as these are units that have not been bought and then sold). 
				<br><br>
				
				We observe that the majority of luxury units have <b>2-3 bedrooms</b>, and that units with <b>more bedrooms</b> have <b>higher average flip horizons</b>. This suggests that larger luxury units are held for longer periods of time before being sold, perhaps because they are more difficult to sell.

				We now turn to Question 2 and analyze <i>how luxury vs. non-luxury residential unit sales have changed over time</i>. We specifically seek to answer whether there has been an increase in luxury apartment purchases, and how the proportion of corporate-owned properties has changed over time. This visualization shows the <b>number of luxury and non-luxury residential units</b> sold each year from <b>2000 to 2022</b>, where again we define luxury units as those with price > $1,000,000. We also visualize the <b>proportion of units bought by a limited liability company (LLC)</b> vs. not. <br><br>

				We observe that the <b>number of residential units over $1,000,000</b> that have been sold has steadily <b>increased over time</b>. On the other hand, we observe that the number of non-luxury residential units sold has decreased over time. This suggests that the luxury residential market is growing, while the non-luxury residential market is shrinking. 
				<br><br>
				We also observe that for both luxury and non-luxury units, the <b>proportion of units bought by an LLC has increased over time</b>. This increase in LLC purchases is particularly pronounced for luxury units, where the proportion of units bought by an LLC has increased from 0% in 2000 to 17% in 2022. This suggests that the luxury residential market is increasingly being dominated by companies rather than individuals.

				<figcaption>
				We further analyze the finding from the previous visualization that the luxury residential market is increasingly being dominated by companies rather than individuals. We specifically look at how much money LLCs vs non-LLCs are making from flips of luxury residential units. This visualization shows the <b>average price difference</b> between the <b>buying and selling price</b> of luxury residential units (ie units that are sold for >$1,000,000), where the units are <b>grouped by whether they were bought by an LLC</b>. 
				<br><br>
				We observe that both LLCs and non-LLCs are making <b>positive average price differences</b> from flipping luxury residential units, and that both saw a decrease in average price difference from 2000 to 2001. However, we observe that the <b>average price difference for LLCs</b> is <b>consistently higher</b> than that for <b>non-LLCs</b>, suggesting that LLCs are making more money from flipping luxury residential units than non-LLCs. We also find that although the average price differences for LLCs is variable over time (i.e. it changes vastly from year to year), there has been a <b>general upward trend</b> in the average price difference for LLCs from 2010 to 2022. This suggests that LLCs are making increasingly more money from flipping luxury residential units in recent years.

				<figcaption>
				We also look at <i>whether these luxury purchases are explained by buyers who own many properties</i>. This visualization shows the <b>average number of properties owned by the buyers</b>, where the properties are <b>grouped by whether they were bought by an LLC</b>. The x-axis shows the <b>year</b> that the luxury residential unit was bought. Again we consider only units sold for >$1,000,000.

				<br><br>
				We observe that the <b>average number of properties owned by buyers</b> used to be <b>higher for non-LLCs</b> than for <b>LLCs</b>, but that this trend has <b>reversed</b> in recent years: Since 2018, <b>LLCs</b> have owned <b>more properties</b> than <b>non-LLCs</b>. This suggests that the luxury residential market is increasingly being dominated by companies that own many properties, rather than individuals.

				<br><br>
				We also observe that there is a large spike in year 2006, as in the previous plot. This suggests that part of the reason for the spike in the average price difference for LLCs in 2006 may be that LLCs were buying luxury residential units in 2006 that were part of a larger portfolio of properties, which perhaps allowed them to make more money from flipping these units.

				We now turn to our third question looking at <i>where luxury properties are being bought and sold.</i> We start by gaining an <b>overview of the zipcode data</b>, which we will use as our primary geographical metric. This visualization shows the unique zipcodes that appear in the dataset (for residential properties). 
				
				<br><br>
				This visualization immediately highlights that there are two zipcodes that are <b>outliers</b> in that they do not appear to be in Boston. These zipcodes are <b>orange</b> in the visualization. The top left zipcode is 02138, and on further inspection of the data, it shows that it corresponds to three rows at the same address, 381 Beacon St. Upon further research, it is clear that this address should have the zipcode 02116. We thus conclude that this is a data entry error and map the zipcode to 02116 for future analysis. <br><br>
				
				The bottom right anomaly is zipcode 02190, which appears to be in Weymouth, MA. Upon further inspection of the data, this zipcode also corresponds to 3 rows at the same address, 40 Battery St #PH4, which is located in 02109. We thus conclude that this is a data entry error and map the zipcode to 02109 for future analysis. <br><br>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>



			<figure>
				<img src="images/img6.svg" alt="" width="100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				After cleaning the zip codes, we now seek to visualize <i>how the average selling price of residential units varies by zipcode</i>. We specifically look at properties bought in the year 2022 to analyze the most recent purchases. This visualization shows the <b>verage selling price of residential units</b> by <b>zipcode</b>, with annotations for average selling price in millions.

				<br><br>
				
				We observe that the zipcodes with the <b>highest average selling prices are clustered in the downtown area</b>, particularly in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill, and South End neighborhoods. Some of the most expensive zipcodes include 02108, 02205, 02210, 02110, and 02199. We also observe that the zipcodes with the <b>lowest average selling prices are clustered in the outskirts of Boston</b>, such as in the Dorchester neighborhood. These insights suggest that the most expensive residential units are being sold in the downtown area, while the least expensive residential units are being sold in the outskirts of Boston. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/img7.svg" alt="" width="100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				We now turn to analyze <i>whether the zipcodes with the highest average selling prices can be explained by newly constructed luxury buildings.</i> We specifically look at how the <b>average selling price of residential units</b> varies by <b>year built</b> for the (cleaned) zipcodes we have been exploring. This visualization shows <b>zipcodes</b> in decreasing order of <b>average selling price</b>, and bars are colored by the average <b>year that units in the zipcode were built</b>. We again filter for units bought in the year 2022 to analyze the most recent purchases.

				<br><br>
				This visualization highlights that the most expensive zipcodes, 02199 and 02205, have, on average, more recently built units than the other zipcodes. This suggests that the high average selling prices in these zipcodes may be explained by the construction of new luxury buildings. The next most expensive zipcode, 02108, has an older average year built, suggesting that the high average selling price in this zipcode may be due to other factors, such as the historical significance of the neighborhood. Upon further research, we find that 02108 is the zipcode for Beacon Hill, which is known for its historic charm and high property values, suggesting that the high average selling price in this zipcode may be due to the historical significance of the neighborhood. Lastly, we note that some of the lesser expensive zipcodes also have more recently built units; this observation suggests that very expensive (luxury) buildings are not the only new buildings being constructed in Boston.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/img10.svg" alt="" width="100%"/>
				<figcaption>
				To visualize how the average years of construction of units are geographically distributed throughout the city of Boston, we create a map showing the <b>average construction year</b> of residential units by <b>zipcode</b>. We again filter by property sale year 2022. The map is colored by the average year built, with darker colors indicating more recent years. 
				<br><br>
				We observe that the zipcodes with the most recently built units are not clustered in the downtown area, but rather are in the outskirts of the city (with the exception of zipcodes 02199 and 02205, the most expensive units from the previous visualizations). This suggests that the most recently built units are not necessarily the most expensive, and that the most expensive units are not necessarily the most recently built. It also suggests that 02199 and 02205 are outliers in that they have both the most recently built units and the highest average selling prices, probably due to the construction of new luxury buildings.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In this exploratory data analysis, we explore 1) the kinds of properties that are being sold in Boston, with a focus on luxury units, 2) how the types of property purchases have changed over time, and 3) where luxury buildings are being bought. For each of these questions, we first check the data quality and overall distribution; these checks allow us to identify and correct data entry errors (e.g. incorrect zip codes) and to filter out data not relevant to our questions (e.g. non-residential properties). 
			<br><br>
			We find that luxury units are primarily 2-3 bedroom units, and that units with more bedrooms have higher average flip horizons. We also find that the number of luxury residential units sold has steadily increased over time, and that the proportion of units bought by an LLC has increased over time. We find that both LLCs and non-LLCs are making positive average price differences from flipping luxury residential units, and that LLCs are making more money from flipping luxury residential units than non-LLCs. We also find that the average number of properties owned by buyers has increased over time, and that LLCs have owned more properties than non-LLCs since 2018. Lastly, we find that the most expensive residential units are being sold in the downtown area, while the least expensive residential units are being sold in the outskirts of Boston. 
			<br><br>
			Together, these findings suggest that the luxury residential market is growing, and that it is increasingly being dominated by companies rather than individuals. These findings align with the Boston Globe article on Towers of Wealth, which talked about the increasing number of luxury residential units being built in Boston, amidst a decreasing number of non-luxury residential units available to the population.
